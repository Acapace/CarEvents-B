# CarEvents-B
Technologies used:
-Python/Django

The Project:
I decided to go with Python/Django as I enjoy this backend framework! One of my goals was to learn more and get more comfortable as i would love to master this. I also wanted to step out of my comfort zone a bit and explore more with the models. I did create multiple models for this project. I also learned the One-One, One-Many and Many-Many model framework. 

Struggles:
-I attempted to add a user authentication to this project as i have not done so but i did not complete this task.
-I also was unable to use a model on the frontend, I need to work better with time management.
